# VOD Link Tracker

Often when thinking back to a tweet or video shown on stream, it can be tedius at best and impossible at worst, to go back in the vod and find the link you were looking for. The goal of this project is to try and generate a set of links shown on stream in a much more accessible way.

This is mostly a hack project so the goals will be coarse and simple, but hopefully useful. The first phase is to simply set up the base infrastructure to support generating these vod manifest files and publishing them. Some more long term stretch goals for this project is to support searching, visualizations, time-shown breakdowns, etc.

## Goals

The major milestones currently for phase one are as follows

- [ ] Generate markdown file of all links from a vod file (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Static site builder using hugo
- [ ] Build infra to allow others to easily run this
